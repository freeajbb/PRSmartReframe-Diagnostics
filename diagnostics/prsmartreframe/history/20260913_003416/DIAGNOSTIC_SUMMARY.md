## GPT analysis request

Please inspect this diagnostic directory as a whole. Start with `manifest.json`, then prefer the shallow `GPT_ANALYSIS_BUNDLE.json`. When Phase 5B-6 evidence is present, review it first: Admission decision, current runtime state, immutable Admission integrity, execution-order/items digests, stale/invalid authority acceptance, current Preflight result, Admission/Preflight Premiere Writes, mutation dispatches, Provider Calls, and confirmation that Production Apply / Production Use / Batch Apply remain OFF. Phase 5B-6 generated summaries are diagnostic audit-only and never by themselves prove Windows Acceptance PASS. Then review Phase 5B-5 as the frozen upstream mutation baseline and explicitly answer: Duplicate Dispatch? Receipt-less COMMITTED? Unknown mutation followed by later execution? Parallel Host Mutation? Unverified item executed? Verify executionOrder, restart reconciliation, negative writes, provider calls, Receipt/Reservation/Ledger authority and Dedicated Rollback evidence. For Phase 5B-4B first verify source Reservation SHA, Original Receipt SHA, Written Fixture, mutation RPC behavior, Negative Premiere Writes, Written Baseline Restore, Final Cleanup, and Original Before-State. Continue through Phase 5B-4B / 5B-4A / 5B-3 / 5B-2 / 5B-1 and upstream preview phases as applicable.
